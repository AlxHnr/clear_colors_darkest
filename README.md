# Clear Colors Darkest

This is an ultra low contrast variant of the dark color scheme from
[clear\_colors](https://github.com/AlxHnr/clear_colors). It does not
support as many plugins as the original and is not as mature. It depends on
[clear\_colors](https://github.com/AlxHnr/clear_colors), since it shares
common highlighting groups and uses its internal functions for color
conversion.
